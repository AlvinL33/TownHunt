# TownHunt

App files optimised for 4.7" iPhones (e.g. iPhone 5, 6 & 7, Not Plus models)

Work In Progress. Will tidy up code redundancy in near future.


UPDATE

With version 1.1, the application now connects to my SQL database on my website. I have written a PHP API (TownHunt API) to server as the interface between the application and the database.

Inside the application there is now a login/registration page where users can create accounts. There is also an account page with information about the logged in account

I am currently developing a system for user created pin packs to be uploaded to the database
